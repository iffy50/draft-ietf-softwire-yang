    <section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">
      <t>The IETF Softwire working group has developed several IPv4-in-IPv6
      softwire mechanisms to address various deployment contexts and
      constraints. As a companion to the architectural specification
      documents, this document focuses on the provisioning of address plus
      port (A+P) softwire functional elements: Border Routers (BRs) and
      Customer Premises Equipment (CEs, a.k.a., CPE). The softwire mechanisms
      covered in this document are Lightweight 4 over 6 (lw4o6) <xref
      target="RFC7596"></xref>, Mapping of Address and Port with Encapsulation
      (MAP-E) <xref target="RFC7597"></xref>, and Mapping of Address and Port
      using Translation (MAP-T) <xref target="RFC7599"></xref>.</t>

      <t>This document focuses on A+P mechanisms <xref
      target="RFC6346"></xref>; the reader can refer to <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-softwire-dslite-yang"></xref> for a YANG module for
      DS-Lite <xref target="RFC6333"></xref>.</t>

      <t>This document defines YANG modules <xref target="RFC7950"></xref>
      that can be used to configure and manage A+P softwire elements using the
      NETCONF <xref target="RFC6241"></xref>, or RESTCONF <xref
      target="RFC8040"></xref> protocols for:</t>

    <section anchor="terminology" title="Terminology">
      <t>The reader should be familiar with the concepts and terms defined in
      <xref target="RFC7596"></xref>, <xref target="RFC7597"></xref>, <xref
      target="RFC7599"></xref>, and the YANG data modelling language defined
      in <xref target="RFC7950"></xref>.</t>

      <t>The YANG modules in this document adopt the Network Management
      Datastore Architecture (NMDA) <xref target="RFC8342"></xref>. The
      meanings of the symbols used in tree diagrams are defined in <xref
      target="RFC8340"></xref>.</t>

      <t>The document uses the abbrieviation 'BR' as a general term for
      softwire tunnel concentrators, including both MAP Border Routers <xref
      target="RFC7597"></xref> and Lightweight 4over6 lWAFTRs <xref
      target="RFC7596"></xref>.</t>

      <t>For brevity, "algorithm" is used to refer to the "mapping algorithm"
      defined in <xref target="RFC7597"></xref>.</t>

      <t>A network element may support one or multiple instances of a softwire
      mechanism; each of these instances (i.e., binding instances, MAP-E
      instances, or MAP-T instances) may have its own configuration and
      parameters. The term 'algo-instance' is used to denote both MAP-E and
      MAP-T instances.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="overview" title="Overview of the Modules">
      <section title="Overall Structure">
        <t>The document defines the following two YANG modules for the
        configuration and monitoring of softwire functional elements:</t>

        <t><list hangIndent="22" style="hanging">
            <t hangText="ietf-softwire-ce">Provides configuration and
            monitoring for softwire CE element. This module is defined as
            augments to the interface YANG module <xref
            target="RFC8343"></xref>.</t>

            <t hangText="ietf-softwire-br">Provides configuration and
            monitoring for softwire BR element.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>In addition, the following module is defined:</t>

        <t><list hangIndent="22" style="hanging">
            <t hangText="ietf-softwire-common">Contains groups of common
            functions that are imported into the CE and BR modules.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>This approach has been taken so that the various modules can be
        easily extended to support additional softwire mechanisms, if
        required.</t>

        <t>Within the BR and CE modules, the YANG "feature" statement is used
        to distinguish which of the different softwire mechanism(s) is
        relevant for a specific element's configuration. For each module, a
        choice statement 'ce-type' is included for either 'binding' or
        'algorithm'. 'Binding' is used for configuring Lightweight 4over6,
        whereas 'algorithm' is used for configuring MAP-T or MAP-E.</t>

        <t>In the 'algo-instances' container, a choice statement 'data-plane'
        is included to specify MAP-E (encapsulation) or MAP-T (translation).
        <xref target="table_s46_mechanism_choices"></xref> shows how these
        choices are used to indicate the desired softwire mechanism:</t>

        </texttable>

        <t>NETCONF notifications are also included.<list style="empty">
            <t>Note: Earlier versions of this specification combined the
            softwire mechanisms by their associated technologies rather than
            their function in the architecture. As the document was revised,
            it became apparent that dividing the modules by their role in the
            architecture (CE or BR) was a better approach as this follows the
            intended function and existing implementation approaches more
            closely.</t>
          </list></t>
      </section>

      <section title="Additional Components Configuration">
        <t>The softwire modules only aim to provide configuration relevant for
        softwires. In order to fully provision a CE element, the following may
        also be necessary:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>IPv6 forwarding and routing configuration, enabling the CE to
            obtain one or more IPv6 prefixes for softwire usage. A YANG module
            for routing management is described in <xref
            target="RFC8349"></xref>.</t>

            <t>IPv4 routing configuration, to add one or more IPv4 destination
            prefix(es) reachable via the configured softwire. A YANG module
            for routing management is described in <xref
            target="RFC8349"></xref>.</t>

            <t>Stateful NAT44/NAPT management, to optionally specify a port
            set (Port Set Identifier (PSID)) along with its length. A YANG
            module for NAT management is described in <xref
            target="I-D.ietf-opsawg-nat-yang"></xref>.</t>

            <t>Stateless NAT46 management, required by softwire translation
            based mechanisms (i.e., the assignment of a Network-Specific
            Prefix to use for IPv4/IPv6 translation). A YANG module for NAT
            management is described in <xref
            target="I-D.ietf-opsawg-nat-yang"></xref>.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>As YANG modules for the above functions are already defined in
        other documents, their functionality is not duplicated here and they
        should be referred to, as needed. <xref
        target="lw4o6-ce-example"></xref> provides XML examples of how these
        modules can be used together.</t>

        <t>The CE must already have minimal IPv6 configuration in place so it
        is reachable by the NETCONF client to obtain softwire configuration.
        If additional IPv6 specific configuration is necessary, the YANG
        modules defined in <xref target="RFC8344"></xref> and <xref
        target="RFC8349"></xref> may be used.</t>

        <t>This module augments "ietf-interfaces", defined in <xref

      "Binding is used for configuring the Lightweight 4over6 mechanism.

       Binding based softwire mechanisms are IPv4-over-IPv6 tunnelling
       transition mechanisms specifically intended for complete
       independence between the IPv6 subnet prefix (and IPv6 address)
       and IPv4 address, with or without IPv4 address sharing.

       This is accomplished by maintaining state for each softwire
       (per-subscriber state) in the central Border Relay (BR) and using
       a hub-and-spoke forwarding architecture. In order to delegate the
       NAPT function and achieve IPv4 address sharing, port-restricted
       IPv4 addresses needs to be allocated to CEs.

       This feature indicates that the network element can function as
       one or more binding based softwire instances.";

       and IPv4 address, with or without IPv4 address sharing.

       This is accomplished by maintaining state for each softwire
       (per-subscriber state) in the central Border Relay (BR) and using
       a hub-and-spoke forwarding architecture. In order to delegate the
       NAPT function and achieve IPv4 address sharing, port-restricted

      <t>The YANG modules defined in this document is designed to be accessed
      via network management protocols such as NETCONF <xref
      target="RFC6241"></xref> or RESTCONF <xref target="RFC8040"></xref>. The
      lowest NETCONF layer is the secure transport layer, and the
      mandatory-to-implement secure transport is Secure Shell (SSH) <xref
      target="RFC6242"></xref>. The lowest RESTCONF layer is HTTPS, and the
      mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS <xref
      target="RFC8446"></xref>.</t>

      <t>The NETCONF access control model <xref target="RFC8341"></xref>
      provides the means to restrict access for particular NETCONF or RESTCONF
      users to a preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or RESTCONF
      protocol operations and content.</t>

      <t>All data nodes defined in the YANG modules which can be created,
      modified, and deleted (i.e., config true, which is the default) are
      considered sensitive. Write operations (e.g., edit-config) applied to
      these data nodes without proper protection can negatively affect network
      operations.</t>

      <t>If the BR is controlled by a non-authorized entity, this entity can
      instruct the BR to install entries which in turn will induce a DDoS
      attack by means of the notifications generated by the BR. This DDoS can
      be softened by defining a notification interval, but given that this
      interval parameter can be disabled or set to a low value by the
      misbehaving entity, the same problem will be observed. </t>
